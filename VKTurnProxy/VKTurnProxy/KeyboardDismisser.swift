/// UITapGestureRecognizer directly on the window instead — outside SwiftUI's
/// hit-testing entirely — with `cancelsTouchesInView = false` so it never
/// blocks a button, row tap, or anything else already listening; it only
/// ever adds "also resign the keyboard" on top of whatever that tap already
/// does.
///
/// An earlier version of this file was reverted after the keyboard stopped
/// appearing at all in testing. Root cause turned out to be unrelated:
/// stale iOS Simulator state (fixed by Simulator → Device → Erase All
/// Content and Settings) — confirmed by the SAME failure reproducing on a
/// completely clean checkout with none of this code present. Restored, and
/// this paragraph is the ONE account of that episode: do not re-add the
/// "UIKit tap gesture broke focus" reading elsewhere, it was the simulator.
///
/// Device-verified 2026-08-07 (iPhone SE3) against the case that looks most
/// dangerous — typing inside a WKWebView, i.e. the VK login and the VK ID
/// screens, where losing focus mid-form would break the cookie auth the app
/// depends on. It is not affected, and the reason is structural rather than
/// lucky: in a WKWebView the first responder is the WKContentView, whose
/// bounds span the whole page, so every tap on web content is INSIDE the
/// responder and `shouldReceive` declines the gesture. The recognizer can
/// only fire outside the web view — e.g. on the sheet's own header — where
/// dismissing is what you want anyway.

/// Standard "find the current first responder" trick — UIResponder exposes
/// no direct API for it, so this asks the responder chain itself: `sendAction`
/// with a nil target routes to whatever IS first responder, which records
/// itself here.
